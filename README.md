![Screenshot of the website page](./assets/screenshot.jpg)

This website provides a means of searching the current weather of a city as well as the five-day forecast.
<br>It uses the OpenWeathermap API to first find the latitude and longitude of the searched city in order to format search parameters.
<br>It then provides the current weather in a larger box. The temperature, type of weather conditions, wind speed, and humidity will all be show.
<br>Five smaller boxes will be generated beneath that, displaying the same data forecasted for the next five days.
<br>Up to five previously searched cities will be saved in localStorage.
<br>The buttons representing previously searched cities can be clicked to once again retrieve their data.
